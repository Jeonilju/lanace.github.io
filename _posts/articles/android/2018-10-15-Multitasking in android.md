In the last few years, features in smartphones have improved a lot. Whether it is the external appearance (bezel-less and large screens) or the internals (RAM, software, etc.), it’s no surprise that the smartphones are now extremely powerful devices.



Even on 6-inch screens, one can multitask and use two apps efficiently at the same time. Available on Samsung devices for many years now, Google introduced the split-screen feature in Android Nougat. With this feature, you can open two apps simultaneously on the same screen.

In Android Oreo, Google didn’t change much related to the multitasking feature except introducing the picture-in-picture mode (PIP). However, in Android Pie, Google has changed the way you multitask. While the basic functionality is the same i.e. you can switch between recent apps and open two apps on the same screen, the way you access it has changed completely.

So, in this post, we will tell you how to multitask in Android 9 or P.
